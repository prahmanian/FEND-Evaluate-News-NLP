# FEND-Evaluate-News-NLP
This is the fourth project in the Udacity Front-End NanoDegree program.
The goal of this project is to analyze a URL input (e.g. blog post, article) using the MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis api.

## Testing
We are using Jest for unittesting. A test suite has been provided for each javascript function in the src/js directory. These tests are found in the __test__ directory. To run unittests in the terminal use the command:

'''bash
npm run test
'''
